          <p>NFTs are not a digital currency, security, commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument
            and have not been registered under the securities laws of any country, including the securities
            laws of any jurisdiction in which a potential token holder is a resident. The NFTs are not being
            offered or distributed to, as well as cannot be resold or otherwise alienated by their holders to,
            citizens of, natural and legal persons, having their habitual residence, location or their seat of
            incorporation in the country or territory where transactions with NFTs are prohibited or in any
            manner restricted by applicable laws or regulations. If such restricted person purchases the tokens,
            such restricted person has done so on an unlawful, unauthorized and fraudulent basis and in this
            regard, shall bear negative consequences.</p><br />

          <p>Each purchaser of the NFTs is reminded that this Website has been presented to him/her on the

            accordance with the laws of the purchaser’s jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of each potential
            purchaser of the tokens to determine if the purchaser can legally purchase the tokens in the
            purchaser’s jurisdiction and whether the purchaser can then resell the tokens to another purchaser
            in any given jurisdiction.</p><br />

          <p>You accept and acknowledge:</p>
          <ul className='px-7 list-disc'>
            <li>The value of an NFTs is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and
              fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT
              prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that
              you may lose money.</li>
            <li>A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems
              could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications,
              and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.</li>

            <li>he regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens,
              cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies
              may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.</li>

            <li>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transa ctions.
              Aperians is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your NFTs</li>

            <li>There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third
              parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of
              purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata
              decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable.
              You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any
              decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or
              accounts/collections.</li>

            <li>We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not
              control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to
              complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions
              are irreversible and Aperians has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.</li>

            <li>There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including,
              but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections,
              the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
              unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge
              that Aperians will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
              distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain
              network, however caused.</li>

            <li>he Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a
              good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions
              or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot
              comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such
              platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a
              prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.</li>
            <li>Aperians reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of
              these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on Aperians.
              Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on Aperians or an inability to use
              the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any
              blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against Aperians.</li>

            <li>if you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS,
              DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND
              UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH
              DISPUTES. IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY
              PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD
              OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE
